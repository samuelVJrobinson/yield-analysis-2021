  abstract  = {Comparisons were made between yield measurements with an impact based yield sensor and an electronic scale in adjacent harvest strips and on the same grain stream within a combine. Yield measurements in adjacent strip comparisons were more prone to errors as the segment lengths decreased. Grain yield difference between the yield sensor and electronic scale ranged from 5 to 14%, 4 to 13%, 3 to 12%, and 2 to 11% for 15, 30, 60, and 300 m long segments. The yield differences between neighboring segments might have been caused by yield variability to a degree; however, a consistent decrease in yield differences with increasing segment lengths implied that better accuracies could be obtained in longer management areas. The combine responses to grain yield changes and the effect of varying ground speed on accuracy were also evaluated by creating artificial yield patterns in harvest strips. Grain diffusion within the combine was more obvious when abrupt yield changes were introduced at known locations. Grain mixing and redistribution inside the combine may dictate the selection of segment sizes in the site-specific decision making process. Constant ground speed provided more stable grain flow values than varying ground speed. The average error in yield estimate was 3.4% and 5.2% at constant ground speed and varying speed, respectively. Careful calibration and constant combine speed were important to achieve better accuracy with the grain yield monitor.},

  abstract  = {Floral plantings are promoted to foster ecological intensification of agriculture through provisioning of ecosystem services. However, a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of different floral plantings, their characteristics and consequences for crop yield is lacking. Here we quantified the impacts of flower strips and hedgerows on pest control (18 studies) and pollination services (17 studies) in adjacent crops in North America, Europe and New Zealand. Flower strips, but not hedgerows, enhanced pest control services in adjacent fields by 16% on average. However, effects on crop pollination and yield were more variable. Our synthesis identifies several important drivers of variability in effectiveness of plantings: pollination services declined exponentially with distance from plantings, and perennial and older flower strips with higher flowering plant diversity enhanced pollination more effectively. These findings provide promising pathways to optimise floral plantings to more effectively contribute to ecosystem service delivery and ecological intensification of agriculture in the future.},

  year      = {2021},
  volume    = {In press},
  abstract  = {1. Pollinators experience large spatio-temporal fluctuations in resource availability when mass-flowering crops are rotated with resource-poor cereal crops. Yet, few studies have considered the effect this has on pollinator population stability, nor how this might be mitigated to maintain consistent crop pollination services.

2. We assess the potential of boundary features (standard narrow 1m grassy margins, hedgerows and wide 4m agri-environment margins) to support and stabilise pollinator populations and pollination service in agricultural landscapes under crop rotation. Assuming a six-year rotation, we use a process-based pollinator model to predict yearly pollinator population size and in-crop visitation rates to oilseed rape and field bean across 117 study landscapes in England with varying amounts of boundary features. We model both ground-nesting bumblebees and solitary bees and compare the predictions including and excluding boundary features from the landscapes.

3. Ground-nesting bumblebee populations, whose longer-lifetime colonies benefit from continuity of resources, were larger and more stable (relative to the no-features scenario) in landscapes with more boundary features. Ground-nesting solitary bee populations were also larger but not significantly more stable, except with the introduction of wide permanent agri-environment margins, due to their shorter lifetimes and shorter foraging/dispersal ranges.

4. Crop visitation by ground-nesting bumblebees was greater and more stable in landscapes with more boundary features, partly due to increased colony growth prior to crop flowering. Time-averaged crop visitation by ground-nesting solitary bees was slightly lower, due to females dividing their foraging time between boundary features and the crop, but the more stable delivery compensated for this by nonetheless increasing the minimum pollination service delivered in any given year.

5. Synthesis and applications. Field boundary features have an important role in stabilising pollinator populations and pollination service in rotational systems, although maintenance of larger semi-natural habitat patches may be more effective for stabilising less mobile solitary bee populations. We recommend using combinations of boundary features, accounting for pollinator range when spacing features/rotating crops, and synchronising boundary feature management with crop rotation to maximise their stabilising benefits.},

The increases are due to reduced wind erosion, improved microclimate, snow retention and reduced crop damage by high winds. Crops differ in their responsiveness to shelter. Of the field and forage crops tested, winter wheat, barley, rye, millet, alfalfa and hay (mixed grasses and legumes) appear to be highly responsive to protection, while spring wheat, oats and corn respond to a lesser degree. Shelterbelt height and longevity, field width and shelterbelt orientation are major considerations in determining the effect of shelterbelts on crop yields. Precipitation has an effect on the percentage yield increase reported. Generally, percentage yield increases due to shelterbelts have been higher in drier regions or in drier years. By proper shelterbelt design and maintenance and the use of responsiveness crops, shelterbelt benefits to crop yields can be optimized.},

  abstract  = {Shelterbelts planted to control wind erosion indirectly affect the adjacent crop. Yield data were collected during 3 yr from 15 fields cropped mainly to spring wheat seeded on fallow, to quantify the competition and sheltering effects of the shelterbelts (about 6 m high and 200 m apart) and to relate these to microclimate and plant-available soil N, P and water. In 1989 and 1990, when moisture conditions during the growing season were dry and close to average, respectively, competition by the trees and their approximately 5-m-wide grass edge reduced crop yield about 10 m into the field. Yields were slightly above the field mean about 10–20 m from the field edge. The competition effect was smaller and the zone of improved crop growth was absent in 1991 when water was abundant. Plant-available N and P were close to the field means at the edge of the cultivated fields and were highest about 10 m into the fields. Competition for water is believed to be the main reason for the reduced yields at the edge of the fields as most farmers seed-placed fertilizer P, and response to added fertilizer N appeared independent of distance from the shelterbelt. Competition for water occurs during the growing period of the crop, but also includes water taken up by the shelterbelt when the field is in fallow. The improved crop growth 10–20 m from the field edge appears related to the reduction in potential evaporation as distance to the shelterbelt decreases.},

  abstract  = {- Little is known on the simultaneous delivery of ecosystem services by agri-environment schemes
- We quantify the impact of hedgerows and grass strips on a range of ecosystem services
- We describe multifunctionality and trade-offs on parcel level
- The trade-off between crop yield and other ecosystem services is context specific.

In north western Europe, agricultural systems are generally managed to maximize the potential delivery of provisioning ecosystem services. This has often been at the expense of other ecosystem services. Because the current supply of most ecosystem services is insufficient to meet the increasing demand, particular attention to ecosystem service delivery and hence multifunctionality in agriculture is vital. In this paper, we quantitatively assessed the impact of hedgerows and grass strips bordering parcels with annual arable crops on the simultaneous delivery of a set of ecosystem services and from there we identified synergies and trade-offs on virtual parcels. After a systematic literature search, mixed models were applied on observations from 60 studies and quantitative effect relationships between ecosystem service delivery and hedgerow and grass strip characteristics were developed. Next to the hedgerow, until a distance of twice the hedgerow height, arable crop yield was reduced by 29%. Beyond this distance, until 20 times the hedgerow height, crop yield was increased by 6%. Compared to a similar arable parcel without hedgerow or grass strip, soil carbon stock was 22% higher in the hedgerow, on average 6% higher in the adjacent parcel next to the hedgerow and 37% higher in the upper 30 cm soil layer in the grass strip. Both hedgerows and grass strips intercepted nitrogen from the surface (69% and 67%, respectively) and subsurface (34% and 32%, respectively) flow and phosphorus (67% and 73%, respectively) and soil sediment (91% and 90%, respectively) from the surface flow. More natural predator species were found on parcels with hedgerows, but the number of predators was unaffected. On parcels with grass strips, both predator density and diversity was higher and aphid density was reduced. Our calculations on parcel level indicate that the trade-off between arable crop yield and regulating ecosystem services depends on hedgerow width and height and parcel dimensions. A similar trade-off is found on parcels with grass strips, but increasing grass strip width results in a proportionally higher delivery of regulating ecosystem services.},

  abstract  = {Biodiversity in agricultural landscapes can be increased with conversion of some production lands into ‘more-natural’– unmanaged or extensively managed – lands. However, it remains unknown to what extent biodiversity can be enhanced by altering landscape pattern without reducing agricultural production. We propose a framework for this problem, considering separately compositional heterogeneity (the number and proportions of different cover types) and configurational heterogeneity (the spatial arrangement of cover types). Cover type classification and mapping is based on species requirements, such as feeding and nesting, resulting in measures of ‘functional landscape heterogeneity’. We then identify three important questions: does biodiversity increase with (1) increasing heterogeneity of the more-natural areas, (2) increasing compositional heterogeneity of production cover types and (3) increasing configurational heterogeneity of production cover types? We discuss approaches for addressing these questions. Such studies should have high priority because biodiversity protection globally depends increasingly on maintaining biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes.},

Hedges are characterized by their vegetative cover but also by their base, notably the breadth of the embankment and the various microhabitats made by stones, coarse woody debris, and leaf litter. These features determine the availabilities of arboreal and ground refuges. Their respective roles on biodiversity remain poorly explored. We experimentally manipulated the size of the embankment in newly-constructed hedges in a peri-urban context. We used non-lethal rapid biodiversity assessments and functional indices (accounting for body mass, trophic level, and metabolic mode) to monitor the presence of a wide range of animal taxa. We observed a positive effect of embankment size on animal biodiversity. Various elements of the fauna (e.g. arthropods, reptiles) rapidly colonized newly-constructed hedges provided with an embankment. Guidelines to restore hedgerows should consider embankment size and quality. Both of these features can be improved by simply retaining the materials that are extracted when establishing agricultural plots such that a diversity of microhabitats and ground refuges become available.},

  abstract  = {Hedgerows play important roles in agricultural landscapes and they increase biodiversity by providing habitat refugia for species sensitive to agricultural disturbance. We have studied the characteristics of the communities of harvestmen (Opiliones) inhabiting hedgerows. Harvestmen are terrestrial arachnids associated with soil surface and subsurface and sensitive to land-use and disturbance. We were specifically interested in quantifying how hedgerow characteristics (e.g., elevation, length, width, connectivity, and plant diversity) affect harvestman diversity and community composition. We expected harvestman diversity and community composition to be positively related to both hedgerow size (area, length, width) and biological attributes of hedgerows (e.g., connectivity, plant community diversity). We surveyed hedgerow characteristics and harvestman communities of 20 hedgerows in an upland agricultural landscape in the Western Carpathians. Hedgerow characteristics were measured in the field or derived from GIS layers and we used correlation and ordination methods to relate them to harvestman community metrics. We found surprisingly high taxonomic richness of harvestmen within the studied hedgerows (15 species). Importantly, the Shannon index of harvestman communities was positively related to hedgerow length and hedgerow tree layer species richness and diversity. Harvestman community composition varied with hedgerow area and width. Despite their small total area, hedgerows represented an important habitat for diverse harvestman communities and hedgerow attributes such as size and tree diversity significantly affected the composition and the Shannon index of harvestman communities. Thus, greater lengths and widths of hedgerows can provide habitats for a higher Shannon index of harvestman communities, within surrounding agricultural landscapes.},

The importance of shelterbelt plant diversity for birds was investigated by a survey of 62 sites in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. An area search technique was used to assess bird occurrence. An all subsets and exponential regression analysis approach explored the relationships between woody plant diversity and avifauna diversity (using Hill’s diversity index), whilst seasonal variations were analysed using restricted maximum likelihood. Sixty-six bird species, including many that are woodland-dependent, representing eight foraging guilds, were observed in the shelterbelts. More species of birds occurred and at higher density in more floristically diverse shelterbelts. Other factors found to influence avifaunal use of shelterbelts were woody plant density, shelterbelt width, structural complexity, tree height, crown cover index and elevation. Seasonal analysis confirmed the importance of these independent variables but also revealed the significance of shelterbelt’s proximity to water during summer for birds using this habitat. This study shows that floristic diversity, amongst other factors, is a significant predictor of avifauna diversity in shelterbelts and suggests that shelterbelts may be designed to optimize their wildlife habitat and biodiversity conservation values.},

We use data from 315 transects, completed as part of a national acoustic survey of bat distribution, to examine the incidence of four bat species adjacent to linear features in rural areas. The use of linear features was assessed in relation to hedgerow width, tree density, the presence of water and woodland proximity. To examine the effect of tree density, linear features were classified as either hedgerows without trees, hedgerows with sparse trees (comprising <50% tree canopy) or tree-lines (>50% tree canopy). The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pipstrellus was not affected by tree density; linear features of all types were associated with a similar increase in P. pipistrellus incidence. The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pygmaeus was dependent on both tree density and the proximity of woodland; only linear features containing trees provided an increase in P. pygmaeus incidence regardless of woodland proximity. P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus incidence was not affected by hedgerow width or the presence of water. Incidence of Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus was unaffected by the density of linear features of any type. Many agri-environment schemes offer financial incentives for the creation and management of hedgerows. Optimising the biodiversity gain provided by linear features will maximise the effectiveness of these schemes. Agri-environment measures that encourage the provision and retention of hedgerow trees will benefit bats in agricultural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Semi-natural habitats (SNH) maintain high levels of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning within agroecosystems. While management recommendations for SNH to promote biodiversity and optimize natural pest control, have mostly focused on improving food resources for predators, overwintering conditions have hitherto received less attention. The success of conservation biological control is often hampered by a lack of knowledge on how different habitats and their associated traits drive the overwintering of both, crop pests and their natural enemies. Moreover, there are concerns that SNH may act as reservoirs for crop pests.

We investigated the overwintering of pollen beetles (Meligethes spp.) and their predators (predatory ground beetles) across 40 habitats of all major types of SNH as well as 8 winter oilseed rape (WOSR) fields, to identify the importance of type and key traits of habitats. Overwintering of pollen beetles was higher in WOSR fields (7 individuals per 0.25 m2) and forest edges (4) compared to flower strips (2) or forest interiors (1). Similarly, overwintering of predatory ground beetles was higher in forest edges and WOSR fields (11 and 10 individuals, respectively) than in flower strips, meadows or hedgerows (4, 4 and 2 individuals). The predator-prey ratio (number of predatory ground beetles / number of pollen beetles) was higher in forest edges than in flower strips, meadows or hedgerows, and intermediate in WOSR fields. Pollen beetle numbers were negatively associated with increasing litter cover and positively with increasing bare soil, while predatory ground beetles were positively associated with soil bulk density and bare soil cover. The proportion of SNH at the landscape level (1 km radius) did not affect overwintering pollen beetles, predatory ground beetles or predator-prey ratio.

We conclude that WOSR fields, rather than SNH are the major overwintering habitat and source of spring colonisation of WOSR by pollen beetles. Forest edges promote predatory ground beetles rather than pollen beetle populations according to their disproportionally high value of overwintering individuals. Agri-environmental measures to promote predatory ground beetles rather than pollen beetles should promote overwintering habitats with compact soils and high litter cover.},

A major reason for this are knowledge gaps in the contribution of pollinators to yield, which partly result from difficulties in determining area-based estimates of yield effects from insect pollination under field conditions. We have experimentally manipulated honey bee Apis mellifera densities at 43 oilseed rape Brassica napus fields over 2 years in Scandinavia. Honey bee hives were placed in 22 fields; an additional 21 fields without large apiaries in the surrounding landscape were selected as controls. Depending on the pollination system in the parental generation, the B. napus cultivars in the crop fields are classified as either open-pollinated or first-generation hybrids, with both types being open-pollinated in the generation of plants cultivated in the fields. Three cultivars of each type were grown. We measured the activity of flower-visiting insects during flowering and estimated yields by harvesting with small combine harvesters. The addition of honey bee hives to the fields dramatically increased abundance of flower-visiting honey bees in those fields. Honey bees affected yield, but the effect depended on cultivar type (p = 0.04). Post-hoc analysis revealed that open-pollinated cultivars, but not hybrid cultivars, had 11\% higher yields in fields with added honey bees than those grown in the control fields (p = 0.07). To our knowledge, this is the first whole-field study in replicated landscapes to assess the benefit of insect pollination in oilseed rape. Our results demonstrate that honey bees have the potential to increase oilseed rape yields, thereby emphasizing the importance of pollinator management for optimal cultivation of oilseed rape.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural ecosystems are actively managed by humans to optimize the provision of food, fiber, and fuel. These ecosystem services from agriculture, classified as provisioning services by the recent Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, depend in turn upon a web of supporting and regulating services as inputs to production (e.g., soil fertility and pollination). Agriculture also receives ecosystem dis-services that reduce productivity or increase production costs (e.g., herbivory and competition for water and nutrients by undesired species). The flows of these services and dis-services directly depend on how agricultural ecosystems are managed and upon the diversity, composition, and functioning of remaining natural ecosystems in the landscape. Managing agricultural landscapes to provide sufficient supporting and regulating ecosystem services and fewer dis-services will require research that is policy-relevant, multidisciplinary and collaborative. This paper focuses on how ecosystem services contribute to agricultural productivity and how ecosystem dis-services detract from it. We first describe the major services and dis-services as well as their key mediators. We then explore the importance of scale and economic externalities for the management of ecosystem service provision to agriculture. Finally, we discuss outstanding issues in regard to improving the management of ecosystem services and dis-services to agriculture.},

  abstract  = {Agricultural expansion across tropical regions is causing declines in biodiversity and altering ecological processes. However, in some tropical agricultural systems, conserving natural habitat can simultaneously protect threatened species and support important ecosystem services. Oil palm cultivation is expanding rapidly throughout the tropics but the extent to which non-crop habitat supports biodiversity and ecosystem services in these landscapes is poorly documented. We investigated whether riparian forest fragments (riparian reserves) provide a pest control service or increase pest activity (disservice) within oil palm dominated landscapes in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. We assessed the activity of potential predators of pest herbivores using plasticine caterpillar mimics and quantified herbivory rates on oil palm fronds in areas with and without riparian reserves. We also manipulated the shape and colour of the mimics to assess the extent to which artificial pest mimics reflect a predatory response. The presence of riparian reserves increased the attack rate on mimics by arthropods, but not by birds. Our methodological study suggested attacks on artificial pest mimics provide a better indication of predatory activity for birds than for arthropod predators. Herbivory rates were also not significantly affected by the presence of a riparian reserve, but we found some evidence that herbivory rates may decrease as the size of riparian reserves increases. Overall, we conclude that riparian forest fragments of 30 – 50 m width on each side of the river are unlikely to provide a pest control service. Nevertheless, our results provide evidence that these riparian buffer strips do not increase the density of defoliating pests, which should reassure managers concerned about possible negative consequences of preserving riparian buffers.},

  abstract     = {An ever-expanding human population, ongoing global climatic changes, and the spread of intensive farming practices is putting increasing pressure on agroecosystems and the inherent biodiversity they contain. Non-production vegetation elements, such as woody patches, riparian margins, and inter-crop and restoration plantings, are vital for conserving biodiversity in agroecosystems and are therefore considered key to sustaining the biotic and abiotic processes underpinning sustainable and resilient agroecosystems. Despite this critical role, there is a surprising lack of synthesis of which types of non-production vegetation elements drive and/or support ecological processes and the mechanisms by which this occurs. Using a systematic, quantitative literature review of 342 articles, we asked: what are the effects of non-production vegetation elements on agroecosystem processes and how are these processes measured within global agroecosystems? Our literature search focussed on the effects of non-production vegetation related to faunal, weed, disease, and abiotic processes. The majority (61\%) of studies showed positive effects on ecological processes: non-production vegetation increased the presence, level or rate of the studied process. However, rather than directly measuring ecosystem processes, 83\% of studies inferred processes using proxies for ecosystem function, such as biodiversity and soil physicochemical properties. Studies that directly measured non-production vegetation effects focussed on a limited number of vegetation effects including comparisons of vegetation types, farm-scale configuration, and proximity to vegetation. Moreover, studies directly measuring ecosystem processes were similarly limited, dominated by invertebrate biocontrol, predator and natural enemy spillover, animal movement, and ecosystem cycling. We identify research gaps and present a pathway for future research in understanding the ecosystem components and processes that build resilient, sustainable agroecosystems.},

We hypothesized that insect pollinator and natural enemy abundance would increase in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plots containing flower strips and that the effect would be greatest in the crop rows closest to the flower strips. Three flower treatments were tested: 1) buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), 2) yellow mustard (Brassica hirta), 3) sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima), and cucumbers as a control. Flowers were planted within a commercial cucumber field in 20-m-long strips in a randomized complete block design with six replications in the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. Some floral treatments successfully attracted more beneficial insects than others, but the beneficials did not disperse out to the cucumber plants. Cucumber yield was unaffected by flowers with one exception: in 2015, cucumber yield in the sweet alyssum plots were greater than those in plots with no flowers. Our research indicates that adding flowers to cucumber fields to increase services from beneficial insects needs to be further investigated to better understand the effect of factors such as relative flowering strip size.},

  title    = {Ecosystem services of tree windbreaks in rural landscapes – a systematic review},
  year     = {2021},
  volume   = {In press},
  abstract = {Windbreaks are key structural elements in the rural environment and affect the functionality of landscapes in multiple ways. A broad interdisciplinary view on these functions lacks in scientific literature and common knowledge. This led to underinformed management decisions, a decrease in the number of windbreaks in wide areas, and a subsequent loss of landscape functionality. Therefore, the knowledge on windbreaks and associated ecosystem services (ES) was systematically reviewed to guide the way for a holistic comprehension of such structural landscape elements. We defined eight bundles of ES on the basis of the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services scheme. Search terms that allowed to include only vegetative windbreaks consisting of at least one tree row were combined with appropriate search terms for the eight ES bundles in individual searches resulting in a total of 6,094 hits. We considered only publications that provided quantitative data and allowed to derive a clear effect of windbreaks on ES so that 222 publications from all over the world were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. The outcomes provide information about the dimension of effort, scientific consensus or dissensus, and knowledge gaps in the different research disciplines involved. It was shown that windbreaks bring predominantly positive effects to landscapes in the course of all investigated ES bundles. Apparent positive effects were found for soil protection, biodiversity and pest control, whereas for biomass production, nutrient and water balance, also adverse or indifferent effects were reported. The present review reveals an intense need for further interdisciplinary research using indicators, ES approaches or similar instruments that enable quantitative and comparable statements about the functionality of windbreaks in rural landscapes.},

  abstract  = {Windbreaks are a major component of successful agricultural systems throughout the world. The focus of this chapter is on temperate-zone, commercial, agricultural systems in North America, where windbreaks contribute to both producer profitability and environmental quality by increasing crop production while simultaneously reducing the level of off-farm inputs. They help control erosion and blowing snow, improve animal health and survival under winter conditions, reduce energy consumption of the farmstead unit, and enhance habitat diversity, providing refuges for predatory birds and insects. On a larger landscape scale windbreaks provide habitat for various types of wildlife and have the potential to contribute significant benefits to the carbon balance equation, easing the economic burdens associated with climate change. For a windbreak to function properly, it must be designed with the needs of the landowner in mind. The ability of a windbreak to meet a specific need is determined by its structure: both external structure, width, height, shape, and orientation as well as the internal structure; the amount and arrangement of the branches, leaves, and stems of the trees or shrubs in the windbreak. In response to windbreak structure, wind flow in the vicinity of a windbreak is altered and the microclimate in sheltered areas is changed; temperatures tend to be slightly higher and evaporation is reduced. These types of changes in microclimate can be utilized to enhance agricultural sustainability and profitability. While specific mechanisms of the shelter response remain unclear and are topics for further research, the two biggest challenges we face are: developing a better understanding of why producers are reluctant to adopt windbreak technology and defining the role of woody plants in the agricultural landscape.},

Despite this, adoption of agroforestry in Australian agricultural systems remains low. To implement agroforestry, farmers must be convinced the benefits of including trees outweigh the costs. This review evaluates the available quantitative data on shelter benefits with emphasis on Australian conditions, identifies key research gaps and determines if there is sufficient knowledge to make accurate predictions about impacts on farm productivity.

Availability of quantitative data on windbreak shelter benefits was examined in five key areas; water use and evaporation, crop/pasture production, livestock mortality, livestock productivity and the capacity to model impacts of windbreaks on crop/livestock systems. Good quantitative data exists for many areas, particularly for changes in environmental conditions following tree establishment, however there were many gaps in key areas. Importantly, the ability to predict crop growth under spatially and temporally variable environmental conditions and the impact of windbreaks on livestock productivity is not yet able to be meaningfully quantified. Thus modelling the profitability of windbreaks is difficult and existing models require additional quantitative data to validate and improve them.},

  abstract = {Sustainable agriculture aims to produce sufficient food while minimizing environmental damage. To achieve this, we need to understand the role of agricultural landscapes in providing diverse ecosystem services and how these affect crop production and resilience, that is, maintaining yields despite environmental perturbation.

We used 10 years of English wheat yield data to derive three metrics of resilience (relative yield across the time series, yield stability around a moving average and resistance to an extreme weather event) at 10 km × 10 km resolution. We used remotely sensed maps to calculate measures of landscape structure, including composition (proportions of different land cover types) and configuration (metrics of connectivity and proximity), known to affect ecosystem service delivery (e.g. control of pests by beneficial invertebrates). We then used an information‐theoretic approach to identify the best‐fitting combination of landscape structure predictors for each resilience metric, using a potential yield model to account for the effects of climate and soils.

Relative yield showed a strongly positive relationship with the area of arable land. For yield stability, this relationship was evident but alongside other landscape structure variables in the best‐fitting model. No relationship with arable land was evident for resistance.

Yield stability showed a strongly positive effect of proximity to semi‐natural habitats. For resistance, the best‐fitting model included positive relationships with the cover of semi‐natural habitats and proximity to semi‐natural grasslands.

Synthesis and applications. Landscapes with the highest relative wheat yields did not show the highest yield stability or resistance to extreme events. As resilience metrics were derived from shorter portions of the time series, the importance of semi‐natural habitats compared to arable land increased. This is probably driven by the complex interplay between landscape structure, agricultural management and ecosystem services. These results demonstrate that measuring relative yield over time may be insufficient to capture the full effect that non‐arable components of the landscape, and the ecosystem services they deliver, have on other aspects of resilience, and that there are clear trade‐offs in managing agricultural landscapes to maximize different aspects of crop yield resilience.},

  abstract  = {Abstract In order to make agriculture more sustainable it is important to enhance the natural processes supporting crop production, including pollination and pest control. The distance over which these services are delivered into the crop (referred to as spill-over) sets limitations on biodiversity mediated agriculture sustainability. We assess how pest control of aphids on wheat (Rhopalosiphum padi) and pollinator linked yield gain in oilseed rape decline with distance from the crop edge. For natural pest control we also assess how field margin floristic diversity (simple grass vs. species-rich wildflower) affects pest control. We do not consider the impact of field margins on oilseed rape pollination as perennial dominated field margins are not in flower at the time of oilseed rape seed set and so do not act to attract pollinators. Aphid colonies exposed to invertebrate natural enemies went extinct at a faster rate than colonies where they were excluded. The rate of decline in per capita growth rates of aphid colonies was greatest when exposed to natural predators, with this effect being detected up to 50 m into the crop where species-rich field margins were present. While oilseed rape yield gains were correlated with pollinator (bees and flies) visitation rates, there was no evidence that yield gain declined with distance from the crop edge. Possibly this was due to honeybees showing no evidence of declining visitation rates with distance into the crop (over 200 m). This contrast with bumblebees, solitary bees and flies which showed evidence of declining visitation rates with distance from the crop edge. Our results suggests that for a typical arable field (c. 12 ha) surrounded by species rich field margins, 50% of the total area could benefit from enhanced pest control services. Increased yields of oilseed rape due to insect pollinators of c. 0.4 t ha-1 were identified, but there was no evidence that field size would limit the spatial distribution of yields. Our results have implications for integrated crop management world-wide through the use of variable dose rate applications technologies that could be used to target pesticides to field centres and so help support biodiversity mediated ecosystem services.},

- Sets of small habitat patches with a large total area have high conservation value.


In a review of landscape-scale empirical studies, Fahrig (2017a) found that ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se (fragmentation independent of habitat amount) were usually non-significant (>70% of responses) and that 76% of significant relationships were positive, with species abundance, occurrence, richness, and other response variables increasing with habitat fragmentation per se. Fahrig concluded that to date there is no empirical evidence supporting the widespread assumption that a group of small habitat patches generally has lower ecological value than large patches of the same total area. Fletcher et al. (2018) dispute this conclusion, arguing that the literature to date indicates generally negative ecological effects of habitat fragmentation per se. They base their argument largely on extrapolation from patch-scale patterns and mechanisms (effects of patch size and isolation, and edge effects) to landscape-scale effects of habitat fragmentation. We argue that such extrapolation is unreliable because: (1) it ignores other mechanisms, especially those acting at landscape scales (e.g., increased habitat diversity, spreading of risk, landscape complementation) that can counteract effects of the documented patch-scale mechanisms; and (2) extrapolation of a small-scale mechanism to a large-scale pattern is not evidence of that pattern but, rather a prediction that must be tested at the larger scale. Such tests were the subject of Fahrig's review. We find no support for Fletcher et al.'s claim that biases in Fahrig's review would alter its conclusions. We encourage further landscape-scale empirical studies of effects of habitat fragmentation per se, and research aimed at uncovering the mechanisms that underlie positive fragmentation effects.},

While other sectors of the agricultural industry have established initiatives to maintain wetlands, a common narrative within the conventional cropping sector is that wetland retention leads to lost acreage and overlap of crop inputs, and that there are financial benefits associated with wetland drainage. The objective of this research was to explicitly quantify crop productivity within drained wetland basins, in an effort to better understand the extent to which producers financially benefit from drainage practices. Working collaboratively with canola producers in central Alberta over the 2019 growing season, wetland basins within four quarter sections were mapped using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and wetland basins with clear evidence of surface drainage were identified. Agricultural input and yield data provided by producers was then used to quantify profitability within each drained basin. Average profit for drained basins for each producer ranged between -$145/acre and $76/acre, with an average of $55/acre across all operations. This is compared to an average profit of $203/acre for non-wetland areas across all operations. The results suggest that the financial benefits of drainage are highly variable, and for many drained basins, producers may experience financial losses that may be overlooked when profits are examined only at the field- or operation-level. While this study included a small number of operations, and was limited to one type of crop over a single growing season, the results still provide important insight into the extent to which producers benefit financially from the practice of wetland drainage.},

- Landscape cover influences predatory arthropod abundance in agricultural landscapes.
- Spiders and ground beetles migrate into canola crops during the early summer.
- Grasslands and wetlands act as reservoir habitat between seasons.
- Farmers should consider preserving habitat around fields in order to suppress pests.

Ground-dwelling arthropods can be important generalist predators in agroecosystems, and can use non-crop features as overwintering habitats. However, it is unclear which types of landscape features constitute useful non-crop habitat, and at what spatial scale organisms gather resources. Additionally, the same landscape feature may act as a source or a destination for arthropods at different times of the year, but this is rarely considered. We modeled the abundance of four common species of Canadian prairie arthropods caught in a set of 198 in-field and roadside pitfall traps (June to August of 2017). Functional regression was used in order to simultaneously consider both the habitat preferences and the timing of movement from the land cover classes. Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and Pardosa moesta (Araneae: Lycosidae) were attracted to canola (Brassica napus) during the early summer, then dispersed to grasslands, wetlands, and grassy road margins at the end of the summer. In particular, Pterostichus melanarius aggregated in canola early in the growing season, suggesting that its role in suppressing crop pests may be underestimated. Pardosa distincta (Araneae: Lycosidae) and Phalangium opilio (Opiliones: Opilionidae) showed weak patterns of seasonal migration, and were more influenced by large-scale geographic patterns rather than landscape composition. Our results suggest that predatory arthropods may migrate into canola crops during the early summer, and that grasslands and wetlands may act as seasonal reservoir habitats. Farmers and land managers should consider preserving existing habitat in order to maintain pest-control services across the season.},

  abstract  = {Sustainable agricultural landscapes by definition provide high magnitude and stability of ecosystem services, biodiversity and crop productivity. However, few studies have considered landscape effects on the stability of ecosystem services. We tested whether isolation from florally diverse natural and semi-natural areas reduces the spatial and temporal stability of flower-visitor richness and pollination services in crop fields. We synthesised data from 29 studies with contrasting biomes, crop species and pollinator communities. Stability of flowervisitor richness, visitation rate (all insects except honey bees) and fruit set all decreased with distance from natural areas. At 1 km from adjacent natural areas, spatial stability decreased by 25, 16 and 9% for richness, visitation and fruit set, respectively, while temporal stability decreased by 39% for richness and 13% for visitation. Mean richness, visitation and fruit set also decreased with isolation, by 34, 27 and 16% at 1 km respectively. In contrast, honey bee visitation did not change with isolation and represented > 25% of crop visits in 21 studies. Therefore, wild pollinators are relevant for crop productivity and stability even when honey bees are abundant. Policies to preserve and restore natural areas in agricultural landscapes should enhance levels and reliability of pollination services.},

  abstract  = {Pollinator populations respond to environmental changes operating on different spatial scales, but the contribution of scale-dependent habitat management to crop pollination and yield-gap reduction is little understood. Here, we analyze how bee abundance and their effects on cucumber production in tropical homegardens is driven by factors measured on three spatial scales; the (1) homegarden scale (flower cover of the focal homegarden); the (2) adjacent-habitat scale (amount of homegarden habitat within a 200 m radius around the focal homegarden); and the (3) landscape scale (distance of the focal homegarden to the nearest forest from 0 to 2200 m). We also evaluate bee responses according to functional traits such as body size. We found that bees were affected by factors on multiple spatial scales. On the homegarden scale, the percentage flower cover best predicted pollinator attraction, if, on the adjacent-habitat scale the percentage of surrounding homegardens was at least 20%. On the landscape scale, bee abundance, mainly of small species, increased when homegardens were closer to the forest. Increasing abundance of flower-visiting bees increased cucumber yield, with solitary bees being the most abundant flower visitors. We predicted that a 50% loss in bee abundance would translate into a 47% yield and associated income decline. Homegardens with a flower cover of 50%, being surrounded by a homegarden area of 50% and being established &lt;100 m from the forest can translate in a nine-fold higher yield and income compared to homegardens with low flower cover (~15%), and isolated from other homegardens (~20%) and the forest (~1500 m). Our work suggests that farmers need to be aware of management practices not only at the local and landscape scale but also on the adjacent-habitat scale. Only then farmers can increase wild bee populations to reduce crop yield gaps through pollination services.},

Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems, biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests, and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis. The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From 10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging, farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing, cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects detected.},

- We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 54 studies.
- Field-edge flower plantings consistently increased pollinator richness and abundance in field edges and became more effective as they matured.
- The influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield was inconsistent.
- Factors such as landscape context and crop type may influence when plantings are effective.
- Defining how plantings impact pollinator population growth would help clarify how they impact on crop pollination and pollinator conservation.

Planting flowers along crop field edges is an increasingly common management strategy for addressing pollinator declines and improving crop pollination. However, few reviews have been published summarizing the efficacy of this specific management practice and how it impacts ecosystem service delivery to crops. We conducted a systematic review (54 studies) and meta-analysis (4–29 studies, depending on the response) to determine whether such plantings 1) increase pollinator abundance or richness within field edges, 2) increase the abundance or richness of pollinators visiting crop flowers, or 3) improve crop yields. Our review and meta-analysis suggest that field-edge flower plantings are highly effective at increasing pollinator richness and abundance in field edges and that plantings become more effective as they mature. However, the influence of field-edge plantings on crop pollination and yield is inconsistent. Planting size and richness did not change these results. While this analysis shows that field-edge flower plantings consistently increase pollinator abundance and richness, there remain critical gaps in our knowledge of when and how plantings can improve ecosystem service provision and delivery. Determining if field-edge plantings affect pollinator population growth may clarify how plantings improve crop pollination, while further research on landscape context and crop type may define when this happens.},

  abstract = {1. Agricultural landscapes provide the essential ecosystem service of food to growing human populations; at the same time, agricultural expansion to increase crop production results in forest fragmentation, degrading many other forest-dependent ecosystem services. However, surprisingly little is known about the role that forest fragments play in the provision of ecosystem services and how fragmentation affects landscape multifunctionality at scales relevant to land management decisions.
2. We measured the provision of six ecosystem services (crop production, pest regulation, decomposition, carbon storage, soil fertility and water quality regulation) in soya bean fields at different distances from adjacent forest fragments that differed in isolation and size across an agricultural landscape in Quebec, Canada.
3. We observed significant effects of distance-from-forest, fragment isolation and fragment size on crop production, insect pest regulation, and decomposition.
4. Distance-from-forest and fragment isolation had unique influences on service provision for each of the ecosystem services we measured. For example, pest regulation was maximized adjacent to forest fragments, while crop production was maximized at intermediate distances-from-forest. As a consequence, landscape multifunctionality depended on landscape heterogeneity: the range of field and forest fragment types present.
5. We also observed strong negative and positive relationships between ecosystem services that were more prevalent at greater distances-from-forest.
6. Synthesis and applications. Our study is one of the first to empirically measure and model the effects of forest fragments on the simultaneous provision of multiple ecosystem services in an agro-ecosystem at the landscape and field scales relevant to landowners and managers. Our results demonstrate that forest fragments, irrespective of their size, can affect the provision of multiple ecosystem services in surrounding fields, but that this effect is mediated by fragment isolation across the landscape. Our results also suggest that managing habitat fragmentation and landscape structure will improve our ability to optimize ecosystem service provision and create multifunctional agricultural landscapes.},

2. We suggest “bright spots” as a promising tool to identify levers of change by finding areas that exceed expectations for goals, such as agricultural landscape multifunctionality and biodiversity.
3. We identified bright, dark and average spots within a complex agricultural landscape and explored the associated socioeconomic patterns. We found that areas exceeding expectations for biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality were neither spatially congruent nor in conflict. It was more common for areas to underperform (dark spots) for both biodiversity and multifunctionality than over perform for both (bright spots).
4. While dark spots for multifunctionality were alike in their ecosystem service composition, bright spots were bright in multiple, diverse ways. The socioeconomic attributes that characterize bright and darks spots included both farm characteristics as well as farming practices, suggesting that both have potential to be levers of change.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that while biodiversity and landscape multifunctionality show similar spatial patterns due to underlying biophysical drivers, managing for biodiversity or landscape multifunctionality alone will not implicitly achieve the other in this system. Bright spots (areas exceeding expectations) in multifunctionality were associated with many different combinations of ecosystem services, but dark spots were uniquely agricultural intensive areas devoted to maximizing crop production at the expense of all other services. From a management perspective, specific farm characteristics and farming practices may impact the potential for multifunctionality: increased mechanization, increased agricultural inputs and larger farm size and capital were associated with dark spots, while smaller farms with potentially greater space for innovation were associated with bright spots.},

  abstract  = {A range of policy initiatives have been promoted in recent years to address the decline of bee populations in Europe and North America. Among these has been the establishment of flower-rich habitat within or around intensively farmed landscapes to increase the availability of pollen and nectar resources. The composition of these habitats depends on location and compatibility with adjacent cropping systems, but they often consist of fields planted with temporary flowering cover crops, field borders with perennial or annual flowering species, hedgerows comprising prolifically flowering shrubs, and grass buffer strips (used to manage erosion and nutrient runoff) which are supplemented with dicotyledonous flower species. While the primary objective of such measures is to increase the ecological fitness of pollinator populations through enhanced larval and adult nutrition, such strategies also provide secondary benefits to the farm and the surrounding landscape. Specifically, the conservation of pollinator habitat can enhance overall biodiversity and the ecosystem services it provides (including pest population reduction), protect soil and water quality by mitigating runoff and protecting against soil erosion, and enhance rural aesthetics. Incorporating these secondary benefits into decision making processes is likely to help stakeholders to assess the trade-offs implicit in supplying ecosystem services.},

We hypothesize that this is caused by a lack of a large enough ecological contrast between AEM and non-treated control sites. The effectiveness of AEM may be moderated by landscape structure and land-use intensity. Here, we examined the influence of local ecological contrast, landscape structure and regional land-use intensity on AEM effectiveness in a meta-analysis of 62 European pollinator studies. We found that ecological contrast was most important in determining the effectiveness of AEM, but landscape structure and regional land-use intensity played also a role. In conclusion, the most successful way to enhance AEM effectiveness for pollinators is to implement measures that result in a large ecological improvement at a local scale, which exhibit a strong contrast to conventional practices in simple landscapes of intensive land-use regions.},

Combined effects of landscape context and local placement of agri‐environmental schemes (AES) on natural pest control and within‐field distance functions of natural pest control agents have rarely been addressed but might affect the distribution of biocontrol providers. Importantly, it is currently unknown whether ecosystem services provided by adjacent AES are consistent for different crop types during crop rotation.

In this study, we assessed whether crop rotation from oilseed rape to cereals altered within‐field distance functions of ground‐dwelling predators from adjacent agri‐environmental fields along a gradient in landscape context. Additionally, we recorded crop pests, predation rates, parasitoids as well as crop yields on a total of 30 study sites.

Distance functions varied between trophic levels: Carabid richness decreased while densities of carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles as well as crop yields increased towards the field centres. Distance functions of parasitoids and pests were modulated by the amount of semi‐natural habitat in the surrounding landscape, while the effects of adjacent AES were limited.

Distance decay functions found for ground‐dwelling predators in oilseed rape in the previous year were not always present in cereals. Increasing distance to the field edge also increased effects of crop rotation on carabid beetle assemblages, indicating a source habitat function of field edges.

Synthesis and applications: Distance functions of natural pest control are not universal and the effects of agri‐environmental schemes (AES) in different adjacent crops during crop rotation vary and depend on ecological contrasts. A network of semi‐natural habitats and spatially optimized AES habitats can benefit pest control in agricultural landscapes, but constraints as a result of crop type need to be addressed by annually targeted, spatially shifting agri‐environment schemes for different crops.},

In the Prairie Pothole Region, wetland remnants are a common feature in intensively cultivated landscapes. These wetlands are typically small and often left embedded in the cropland matrix and may act as the only semi-natural feature in a radius of several hundred metres. To quantify the role that these in-field wetlands play in supporting native pollinators, we sampled bees at three distances from the wetland margin into the surrounding cropland (0 m, 25 m and 75 m) across the season in three field types (canola, cereal and perennial grassland). We used Bayesian multilevel models to test the hypothesis that native bees are using infield wetlands as habitat for nesting and foraging. Native bee abundance and diversity decreased further away from the margin of wetlands in both canola and cereal fields, while it increased in wetlands located in perennial grassland. Community composition did not change further away from wetlands, which may be because the foraging range of most species was within the sampling distance of the study. These results suggest that wetlands play an important role in providing critical resources for native pollinators, and encouraging farmers not to drain or plow through these wetlands will have beneficial impacts for native pollinators in the area. Maintaining in-field wetlands may have additional pollination benefits for farmers growing crops such as canola, which is known to benefit from insect visitors.},

However, some current European agri-environment schemes seem to be rather ineffective. A likely explanation is the lack of source populations in intensely cultivated landscapes. Remnants of natural and seminatural habitats can contribute to regional biodiversity in various ways: as essential habitats for specialised species, as stepping stones, and as temporary habitats for hibernation, larval development, or preovipository feeding.

The overall percentage of arthropod species, for which seminatural habitats are an essential prerequisite for living in an agricultural landscape, was assessed with a 5 km long transect of 18 standardised trapping stations. The transect extended from an isolated area of wetland through intensely managed crop fields and grassland to an isolated semiarid meadow bordered by mixed forest.

For more than 1000 arthropod species the spatial and temporal distribution of a one year's catch along the transect was interpreted with regard to their affinity to seminatural habitats. Experts were asked to judge questionable cases of apparent ubiquist species.

All in all, more than 63% of all animal species (except for soil and water fauna) living in the agriculturally managed areas of the Limpach valley seem to depend on the presence of seminatural habitats. We conclude that remnant islands of natural or seminatural habitats provide the most important source populations for agri-environment schemes in order to enhance biodiversity in an otherwise depleted agricultural landscape.},

A key question concerns the degree to which their value for biodiversity is influenced by the features of individual plantings, which can be controlled by local land managers, or by broader-scale drivers in the wider landscape.
2. We developed a conceptual model of factors of potential influence on birds in revegetation plantings at different spatial scales. To test this model, we surveyed native birds in 133 plantings in south-eastern Australia. Regression models were used to compare the effect of ‘habitat-’, ‘patch-’, ‘farm-’ and ‘landscape-’ scale variables on species richness (of woodland and open country birds) and the occurrence of individual species in plantings. We further tested whether the influence of variables representing local actions was swamped by larger-scale variables.
3. Birds that occupied plantings were influenced by variables at all scales. Woodland birds were consistently richer and more likely to use older plantings (patch scale) with higher floristic richness (habitat scale), and surrounded by more wooded vegetation (at patch, farm and landscape scales). Open country species responded positively to the density of live trees (habitat scale) and the presence of large remnant tree/s (patch scale) in plantings.
4. Variables representing local management actions generally maintained a strong influence on birds in plantings irrespective of the influence of broader drivers. Few relationships between bird species and planting attributes were contingent on features of the surrounding landscape; those that were suggested woodland birds are more responsive to local actions when broad-scale vegetation cover is greater.
5. Synthesis and applications. Land managers can enhance the conservation value of plantings by (a) planting a greater diversity of trees and shrubs and (b) locating revegetation near other vegetation or around mature remnant tree/s. These actions will measurably increase the value of plantings for birds, irrespective of larger-scale drivers. Nonetheless, the important role of increased vegetation cover across broader agricultural landscapes emphasises that the collective efforts of individuals and larger initiatives are critical for conservation.},

  abstract  = {- Despite homogeneous management, we found large variability in both crops yields.
- Pollinator exclusion increased spatial and temporal variability of yields.
- Mean visitation rate and its spatial stability enhance pear yield stability.
- Management practices promoting pollinators can increase yield stability.

One of the most important challenges facing global agriculture is to ensure an adequate, stable food supply while conserving soil, water and biodiversity. The yield stability of pollinator-dependent crops, such as pear and apple, can be negatively affected by variability of the pollination service, which in turn can reduce mean yield. We explored how mean crop yield and yield variability were affected by pollinators and variability in their provision of the pollination service. Over four seasons we conducted a manipulative experiment in six pear and eight apple farms; fruit set (i.e., no. fruits/ no. flowers) was compared between flowers exposed to pollinators and those excluded from pollinators. We also recorded pollinator visitation rate to exposed flowers. We estimated the mean levels and spatial and temporal variability of both pollinator visitation and yield response by calculating the mean values per farm and the spatial (i.e., across trees within farm) and temporal (i.e., across seasons within farm) coefficients of variation (CV) for visitation rate and fruit set. Despite homogeneous irrigation and fertilization, we found strong variability in fruit set in both crops (pear spatial and temporal CV: 0.57 and 0.4, respectively; apple: 0.62 and 0.52). Pollinator exclusion reduced mean fruit set considerably in both crops (pears: a reduction of 50%, apples: 71–92%), and increased spatial and temporal variability (pears: 296% and 197% for spatial and temporal variability, respectively; apples: 385% and 329%). Visitation rates in pears were positively associated with mean fruit set and negatively related to its spatial CV. Also, in this crop we found a positive relation between the spatial CV of visitation rate and fruit set. However, there was no evidence that visitation rate in open-pollinated apple flowers affected either mean fruit set or its spatial or temporal variability. Apple trees received one order of magnitude more visits per flower than pear trees, suggesting that in this system the pollination service meets the pollination demand of the apple crop. Overall, our results highlight the importance of management practices that prioritize pollination service, thus ensuring a high, stable yield.},

  abstract  = {Yield mapping is one of the most widely used precision farming technologies. However, the value of the maps can be compromised by the presence of systematic and random errors in raw within field data. In this paper, an automated method to clean yield maps is proposed so as to ensure the quality of further data processing and management decisions. First, data were screened by filtering null and edge yield values as well global outliers. Second, spatial outliers or local defective observations were deleted. The local Moran’s index of spatial autocorrelation and Moran’s plot were used as tool to identify the spatial outliers. The protocol to filter out global and local outliers was evaluated on 595 real yield datasets from different grain crops. Significant improvements in the distribution and spatial structure of yield datasets was found. Approximately 30% of the dataset size was removed from each monitor dataset, with one third of the removal occurring during filtering of spatial outliers. The automation of null, edge yield values and the removal of global outliers improved yield distributions, whereas the cleaning of local outliers impacted the yield spatial structure for all yield maps and crops. The algorithm proposed to clean yield maps is easy to apply for preprocessing the growing number of available yield maps.},

Winner of the 2013 DeGroot Prize.

A state-of-the-art presentation of spatio-temporal processes, bridging classic ideas with modern hierarchical statistical modeling concepts and the latest computational methods

Noel Cressie and Christopher K. Wikle, are also winners of the 2011 PROSE Award in the Mathematics category, for the book “Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data” (2011), published by John Wiley and Sons. (The PROSE awards, for Professional and Scholarly Excellence, are given by the Association of American Publishers, the national trade association of the US book publishing industry.)

Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data has now been reprinted with small corrections to the text and the bibliography. The overall content and pagination of the new printing remains the same; the difference comes in the form of corrections to typographical errors, editing of incomplete and missing references, and some updated spatio-temporal interpretations.

From understanding environmental processes and climate trends to developing new technologies for mapping public-health data and the spread of invasive-species, there is a high demand for statistical analyses of data that take spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal information into account. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data presents a systematic approach to key quantitative techniques that incorporate the latest advances in statistical computing as well as hierarchical, particularly Bayesian, statistical modeling, with an emphasis on dynamical spatio-temporal models.

Cressie and Wikle supply a unique presentation that incorporates ideas from the areas of time series and spatial statistics as well as stochastic processes. Beginning with separate treatments of temporal data and spatial data, the book combines these concepts to discuss spatio-temporal statistical methods for understanding complex processes.

Topics of coverage include:

    Exploratory methods for spatio-temporal data, including visualization, spectral analysis, empirical orthogonal function analysis, and LISAs
    Spatio-temporal covariance functions, spatio-temporal kriging, and time series of spatial processes
    Development of hierarchical dynamical spatio-temporal models (DSTMs), with discussion of linear and nonlinear DSTMs and computational algorithms for their implementation
    Quantifying and exploring spatio-temporal variability in scientific applications, including case studies based on real-world environmental data

Throughout the book, interesting applications demonstrate the relevance of the presented concepts. Vivid, full-color graphics emphasize the visual nature of the topic, and a related FTP site contains supplementary material. Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data is an excellent book for a graduate-level course on spatio-temporal statistics. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics, engineering, and the environmental and health sciences.},
