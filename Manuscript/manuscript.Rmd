# Introduction

Intensive agricultural production has increased over the last 100 years, and agricultural land now makes up over a third of ice-free land on Earth
This has allowed increases in human population and increased (global) stability in production
However, this is not without cost, as higher-diversity non-crops are converted to lower-diversity crops, resulting in loss of habitat and overall biodiversity of non-target organisms
Maintaining both biodiversity and production in agroecosystems represents a seldom-considered goal of conservationists and agronomists, and hold the potential for win-win scenarios
Key to this is the preservation of semi-natural land (SNL), which represents the interface between crops and non-crops within agroecosystems

SNL in and around crops is important for both agricultural production and conservation, as it has the potential to create better biotic and abiotic conditions (Case 2019, https://doi.org/10.1101/624635, Weninger 2021 https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac1d0d)
They are habitat for mobile organisms, and can act as sources of ecosystem services such as pollination or pest control (@albrecht2020; @gardner2021), but this can vary depending on the system (e.g. Quinn et al 2017, https://doi.org/10.1093/jee/tow306)
They also can create microclimate effects that reduce extreme temperature, trap moisture, and reduce wind speed (@kort1988, Brandle et al 2004 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-2424-1_5)
Unfortunately, most of the research is concentrated in Europe, and they tend to be less-studied on other continents
In particular, North American agroecosystems have larger fields, different crop varieties, and agronomic practices, all of which could negate or confound potential effects of SNL
  
<!-- - SNL has conflicting effects on crop yield because of ecosystem service provision as well as negative edge effects -->
SNL may affect yields at intermediate distances, depending on the spatial scale at which ecosystem services operate.
Edge effects cause low yields at the edge of crops because of sparse or late seedling emergence, poor microclimate, and competition with weeds.
At the same time, the centre of large fields will not receive ecosystem services if they decay with distance from edges (@kowalchuk1995).
For example, pollination services from central place foragers that nest in SNL but forage in crops drops rapidly with distance.
Therefore, yield may be maximized at intermediate distances, where the ecosystem services cancel out negative edge effects (e.g. @vanVooren2017).
This suggests a ``goldilocks" field size, where negative edge effects are canceled out by ecosystem services.
<!-- - Less-considered are ecosystem ``disservices", where weeds and pests  -->
<!-- - In North America, there are financial incentives to make fields large, homogeneous, and with simple geometry -->

```{r rawData, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Potential yield patterns, depending on ecosystem service effects with distance. In both figures, negative environmental effects (edge effects) are shown in red, and decrease with distance from the edge of the crop, creating an increase in yield with distance. The left figure shows a decline in ecosystem services with distance, leading to an intermediate peak in yield, while the right figure shows an increase in services with distance, leading to a peak at the centre of the field (note: this also occurs if ecosystem services do not depend on distance).', out.width='75%'}  
  include_graphics('../Figures/ExamplePlots/hypotheses.png',dpi=NA)
```

    
Studies of SNL effects on crop yield also suffer from limited scope (e.g. few crop types) and small sample sizes, limiting inference and reducing generality (Baker et al 2018, https://doi.org/10.1071/CP17242) (but see also wheat study)
Meta-analyses have been the standard solution to this problem (e.g. @albrecht2020), but precision yield data holds enormous promise.
However, its use is limited for several reasons: 1) Lack of standardized formats between equipment types, 2) Sensor calibration required for field-level accuracy, and 3) unfamiliarity with spatial statistics.
Ecosystem services can influence both the mean and variability of yield in agroecosystems (@redhead2020).
Typically only averages (means) are considered, but higher stability (lower variance) in yield can also be valuable.
There are few studies of yield variability (only those with large datasets), but precision yield data opens up the possibility of modeling within-field variability, as well as average yield.
  
In this paper we ask:
  1. How does crop yield change with distance from the edge of field?
  2. Does this depend on type of field edge? 
  3. Is there an intermediate distance where yield is maximized or variance is minimized?

# Methods

## Data collection

Precision yield data were collected directly from farmers across Alberta.
Farmers were solicited for yield data through local agronomists, and we received `r nrow(datSource)` field-years of data from `r length(unique(datSource$grower))` growers across a total of `r length(unique(datSource$year))` years (`r min(unique(datSource$year))`-`r max(unique(datSource$year))`).
We converted raw data to a standard csv format using Ag Leader SMS.
`r round(100*sum(grepl('(Wheat|Canola)',datSource$crop))/nrow(datSource))`% of the crop types where either wheat (_Triticum aestivum_) or canola (_Brassica napus_), two of the most common crops in rotation in Alberta.
The remaining crop types had low replication, so we constrained our analysis to only field-years containing wheat (`r sum(datSourceFinal$crop=='Wheat')`) or canola (`r sum(datSourceFinal$crop=='Canola')`).
Individual fields contained between `r min(yearsPerField)` to `r max(yearsPerField)` years of data (mean: `r round(mean(yearsPerField),1)`), containing a total of `r round(sum(datSource$npoints)/1e6,1)` million data points.
  
Yield data is collected in rectangles of the same length as the data interval (distance = combine ground speed $\times$ interval, typically 1 second) and the same width as the combine header (5-7 m, adjusted to account for overlap with adjacent swaths).
We extracted the size of each polygon (m$^2$), dry yield (tonnes), and the spatial location, and the sequence of collection (1 - end of harvest)
Because of the large number of yield rectangles per field (30-800 thousand), we used the centroid of each polygon as its location, treating areal data as point data
Seeding and application rates were constant across fields, so we did not consider inputs in our analysis
We used dry yield (tonnes of seed/hectare minus recorded crop moisture) as our measure of crop yield
Precision yield data can be highly variable and is prone to extreme outliers (both positive and negative), especially when combine ground speeds are low and at the beginning of rows
Therefore, we filtered data that lay outside the 95th percentiles of yield within each field, values less than or equal to zero, and values outside of the 95th percentiles of ground speed.
Due to the large number of data at each field, we sub-sampled to 50,000 data points per field to reduce computation time.

Field boundaries were automatically digitized using buffers from the yield data locations, then manually checked using satellite imagery from Google Earth and classified land cover data from AAFC. 
Crop boundaries are flexible, and often change yearly depending on planting and emergence conditions (e.g. flooding during some years).
Ephemeral wetlands are flooded during some years, but consist mainly of grasses during dry years, and grass boundaries can change if fields are used for as haying or pasture during crop rotation.
This makes accurate and consistent classification of field boundaries difficult.
We defined the following general categories for field boundaries:
    1. Standard: grassy field edge, staging yard, or road right-of-way (grassy strip typically 5-10m wide) 
    2. Wetland: permanent wetland; borders are largely unchanged from year-to-year
    3. Shelterbelt: permanent windbreaks, shelterbelts, remnant forests, or shrublands
    4. Other crop: annual crop or pasture with little or no visible boundary between planted areas
    5. Bare: unplanted, fallow, flooded area, temporary wetland (only present for a single season), staging yard, oil and gas equipment, or road without a planted boundary
    6. Grassland: permanent seminatural grassland or pasture (not in rotation)
  
    <!-- STANDARD -->
    <!-- WETLAND -->
    <!-- SHELTERBELT -->
    <!-- OTHERCROP -->
    <!-- BARE -->
    <!-- GRASSLAND -->
    
## Analysis

Yield data from each field contains both random and systematic errors that must be modeled in order to reveal underlying changes in yield.
We fit an additive model of the effect of boundary distance on crop yield while accounting for within-field spatial variation and temporal variation in the data.
Crop yield can vary within a field due to soil conditions, moisture, seeding rates, herbicide application, and previous agricultural practices.      <!-- - such as strip farming -->
Ground speed is extremely important to yield monitor accuracy [@arslan2002], with low ground speed registering higher yields.
Sensor calibration can reduce combine-level bias (such as a combine recording consistently higher/lower yields across fields), this does not address sensor drift that occurs over time.
This may be caused by sensors accumulating debris during harvest (especially in canola, pers. comm. Trent Clark), leading to changes in accuracy and bias over time.
To model this, we fit the following model to each field-year of data:
  
  \begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \sqrt{yield} \sim & Normal (\mu, \sigma)\\
  \mu = & Intercept + log(\text{Polygon Size}) + f(\text{Edge Distance}, b=12)_i + \\
   & f(\text{Easting}, \text{Northing}, b=60) + f(\text{Sequence}, b=60) \\
  log(\sigma) =  & Intercept + log(\text{Polygon Size}) + f(\text{Edge Distance}, b=12)_i + \\
   & f(\text{Easting}, \text{Northing}, b=60) + f(\text{Sequence}, b=60) \\
  \end{split}
  \end{equation}
  
  - where:
  1. Polygon Size = distance traveled $\times$ width of header bar ($m^2$)
  2. Edge Distance = distance from field edge type _i_ (m)
  3. Easting, Northing = distance from centre of field (m)
  4. Sequence = order of harvest within field (1--N points)
  5. f(x,b) = penalized thin-plate regression spline, where _x_ is the predictor and _b_ is the number of basis dimensions
  
In addition to modeling edge effects (our variable of interest), this model also accounts for a) differences in harvested area, b) within-field spatial variation not related to edges, and d) shifts in combine accuracy during harvest.
Spatial or temporal variation can be modelled using a Gaussian Process Model (e.g. Kriging, SPDE Approximations) but this was computationally unfeasible with 50,000 data points per field.
Penalized splines offer a compromise, as they account for nonlinear ``wiggly" relationships in the same way as Gaussian processes but using a reduced number of dimensions and computation time.
The number of basis dimensions was checked with the _gam.check_ function from _mgcv_.
The relationship between polygon size and yield was modeled with a log-linear relationship with a single slope term, as this closely matched smoothed versions.
Because polygon size is not intuitive, we converted it into ground speed by regressing speed on distance traveled per polygon, then using this to back-calculate the ground speed for a given polygon size (given a fixed width of header). 
All models were fit in _R_ using the _mgcv_ library [version `r packageVersion('mgcv')`, @wood2017], and figures were created with _ggplot2_ and _ggpubr_ [versions `r packageVersion('ggplot2')`, @wickham2016; and `r packageVersion('ggpubr')`, @kassambara2020].
  
Despite the use of spatial and temporal smoothers, the residuals in most of the models displayed a large amount of spatial and temporal autocorrelation.
_Not really sure how we can get around this. In practice, this means that SEs for all coefficients are too small (i.e. we gathered 1000 points, but because they're spatially related, it's only equivalent to 100 points)._

<!-- - This is extremely common in precision yield data, but  -->

To consider results from all field-level models together, we fit models independent of each other and fit an "overall" smoother as averages of the field-level smoothers.
However, this does not account for uncertainty in the field-level smoothers, so we used an approach similar to bootstrapping of hierarchical mixed effects models:
  1. Extract single posterior sample (_rnorm_ in R) of smoother parameters from each field-level model using coefficient estimates and standard error
  2. Use posterior sample to create a new smoother from each field
  3. Fit new model of new smoothers from all fields, and save this "meta-smoother"
  4. Repeat 1000 times, and calculate coverage intervals (5-95% percentiles) on saved meta-smoothers
This gives coverage intervals (CIs) for the "average" smoother while accounting for field-level variability, and is conceptually similar to a meta-analysis.
Spatial variability was not averaged between fields because differences in field geometry make it impossible to compare fields.

# Results

## Field-level example

The filtered data from each field still contained a large amount of variation, but the non-stationary additive models were able to reveal underlying yield patterns.
To illustrate this, we show the results from a single wheat field, where we show the relative impact of ground speed, harvest sequence, boundary distance, and spatial variation on both yield mean and yield SD ("patchiness").
Figure \@ref(fig:rawData) shows the raw data collected from a single field, demonstrating a large amount of variation even among the filtered data.
Combine ground speed had a large effect on both yield mean and SD, and there was also a strong effect of harvest sequence on yield mean and SD (Figure \@ref(fig:orderSmooths).
Yield mean and SD tended to decrease with distance from field boundaries, but there were no consistent differences between boundary types (Figure \@ref(fig:distSmooths).
Finally, the random spatial smoothers in Figure \@ref(fig:spatialSmooths) show that yield mean and SD systematically vary within fields, likely due to moisture, elevation, or soil conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:spatialSmooths).

## Overall results

Across all fields, Standard (grassy border) field boundaries were the most common boundary type, followed by Shelterbelts and Other Crops.

```


### Canola fields

Overall, there was a strong negative effect of combine ground speed on both the average and variability of canola yield.
At the field level, both yield average and yield variability (SD of yield) of yield were extremely spatially (average p-values: `r with(canolaMods,formatC(meanP[Smoother=='s(E,N)']))`, `r with(canolaMods,formatC(meanP[Smoother=='s.1(E,N)'],3))`) and temporally dependent (`r with(canolaMods,formatC(meanP[Smoother=='s(r)'],3))`, `r with(canolaMods,formatC(meanP[Smoother=='s.1(r)'],3))`), meaning that average and variability changed with location in the field, as well as sequentially during the harvest.
However, there was no difference in average or variability with harvest sequence when all fields were considered, meaning that combines did not appear to distort yield data from start to finish in any systematic way.

Average canola yield tended to increase with distance from Standard and Other Crop boundaries, leveling off at about 25 m (Figure \@ref(fig:canolaPlot) top row, Other crop and Standard panels); yield was approximately 0.1 T/ha (1.5 bu/ac) lower at the edge for both of these boundary types.
Interestingly, Shelterbelts were well-represented in the data (Table \@ref(tab:boundaryTypeTable)) but the negative edge effect was not strong (Figure \@ref(fig:canolaPlot) top row, Shelterbelt panel), indicating that they may provide better micro-climates for crops located near them.
Other boundary types were less common in the data and had correspondingly weaker effects on mean yield, but all showed a small negative edge effect.
Yield variability tended to decrease with distance from the edge of the field, indicating that edge effects contribute to yield "patchiness" as well as averages.
At Standard, Bare, and Wetland field boundaries, variability decreased until about 100 m, after which variability was constant, while the pattern was less consistent in Grassland, Other Crop, and Shelterbelt.

  include_graphics('../Figures/ModelSummary3a_canola.png',dpi=NA)
```

### Wheat fields

Similar to canola, there was a strong negative effect of ground speed on both yield and variability of wheat yield (Figure \@ref(fig:wheatPlotSpeed), left panels).
At the field level, both yield average and yield variability (SD of yield) of yield were spatially (average p-values: `r with(wheatMods,formatC(meanP[Smoother=='s(E,N)']))`, `r with(wheatMods,formatC(meanP[Smoother=='s.1(E,N)'],3))`) and temporally dependent (`r with(wheatMods,formatC(meanP[Smoother=='s(r)'],3))`, `r with(wheatMods,formatC(meanP[Smoother=='s.1(r)'],3))`), but harvest sequence did not distort the average or SD of wheat yield in a systematic way (Figure \@ref(fig:wheatPlotSpeed), right panel).

Average wheat yield increased slightly with distance from the field boundary, but this was much more variable than the patterns seen in canola yield (Figure \@ref(fig:wheatPlot)).
There was also a slight increase in variability away from the field boundary, at least for Standard and Other Crop boundaries, but this was inconsistent among other boundary types. 

```{r wheatPlot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Field boundary effect on canola yield, accounting for the effect of combine speed, spatial variation, and harvest sequence. Upper panel represents mean yield, while the lower panel represents yield variation (i.e. "patchiness").', out.width='100%'}  
  include_graphics('../Figures/ModelSummary3a_wheat.png',dpi=NA)
```

# Discussion

At the level of individual fields, both average and SD of yield varied with distance from the field boundary.
Both metrics also varied with ground speed and harvest sequence, and there were strong spatial relationships within each field, likely related to underlying soil or moisture conditions.
However, the overall effect of field boundary on yield was inconsistent and the change tended to be small.
For example, average canola yield was $\sim$0.5 T/ha lower close to Standard field edges, and yield SD was $\sim$0.3 T/ha SD higher.
So, why did we find few consistent effects of boundary type on canola and wheat yield?
We consider a few potential reasons for this below:
1. Landscape influence
2. Boundary variables
3. Ecosystem disservices
4. Yearly/location variation
5. Lack of pest pressure/pollination deficit

Our analysis only examined boundary types, without considering the landscape context that fields were embedded in
   - Some studies show the influence of landscape composition at larger spatial scales (e.g. Lan's paper) which could be particularly important when beneficial arthropods are highly mobile (e.g. bumblebee foraging) or disperse very broadly (Lynx spider paper from Sweden)
   - There could also be interactions between landscape composition at different scales (e.g. our paper in AGEE), but this is not well-studied
   - Landscape complexity (Fahrig et al 2010,  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01559.x) and connectivity are also associated with higher abundance of beneficial arthropods (Paul's new paper + others)
   - This means that field boundaries such as wetlands or shelterbelts may only be helpful if connected to a larger network of non-crop habitat (but see Redhead 2020(?) ie. SLOSS problem)

Our definitions of boundary type were necessarily loose, as we used satellite imagery to manually classify them
  - However, it may be that other boundary traits, such as size or plant species composition, are more important for spillover of ecosystems services into fields
  - For example, larger hedgerows tend to support more biodiversity than smaller hedgerows (Lecq et al 2018, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2018.08.002, Stasiov 2020 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2020.05.001) or more biodiverse (Bonifacio et al 2011 https://doi.org/10.1071/PC110022)
  - Boughey et al 2011 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2011.02.017) showed that trees within hedgerows are important for bat diversity
  - Increased litter cover and soil compaction increased pollen beetle predators (Sutter et al 2018 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.06.030)

The net flow of ecosystem services may not be positive, if beneficial organisms do not disperse from the SNL, or if pests disperse along with them.
- Ecosystem disservices such as pests and weeds can also disperse from field boundaries, which may negate any positive effect of ecosystem services (Zhang et al 2007 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.02.024)
  - Gray and Lewis 2014 showed that remnant forest fragments do not provide significant pest control services (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2014.09.009)
  - However, this is still poorly studied (but see Woodcock 2015), and parsing out services from disservices is impossible using crop yield data _alone_
  
Since our sampling represents a limited amount of spatial and temporal coverage, there could be additional confounding variables that obscure signals of yield
  - (crop history, differences in tillage)
  - Could vary by location; most fields were from central AB, but effects from southern AB may be confounding the signal
  - Between-year effects may be important, especially when accounting for 
  
Finally, pest pressure or pollination deficit may be at low enough levels that ecosystem service provision does not significantly change yield
  - Canola is largely self-pollinating (at least in the hybrid canola varieties commonly used in Canada) and wheat is wind-pollinated, meaning that insect pollination may not change yields significantly
  - Pest pressures are also limited by growers' application of insecticides (seed-treated or on the crop directly), and insect pest outbreaks tend to be temporally and spatially spotty
  
We used harvest time as smoothed variable to deal with temporal autocorrelation in the data, but this is a crude way to deal with this
  - This is because in-field combine driving patterns _almost always_ induce correlation between spatial and temporal measurements (e.g. northern section of the field was harvested before the southern section), meaning that temporal and spatial random effects are difficult to separate
  - There are few solutions to this using harvest data as-is, other than to ignore temporal random effects entirely, thereby constraining all random variation to be spatial
  - However, it is possible to remove correlation between spatial and temporal measurements by using specially designed harvest patterns within a field (harvesting alternating strips sequentially across the field, then harvesting the remaining strips on a second pass)
  - Future studies could use this to estimate drift in combine sensor measurements over time
