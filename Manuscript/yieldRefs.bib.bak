  abstract  = {Comparisons were made between yield measurements with an impact based yield sensor and an electronic scale in adjacent harvest strips and on the same grain stream within a combine. Yield measurements in adjacent strip comparisons were more prone to errors as the segment lengths decreased. Grain yield difference between the yield sensor and electronic scale ranged from 5 to 14%, 4 to 13%, 3 to 12%, and 2 to 11% for 15, 30, 60, and 300 m long segments. The yield differences between neighboring segments might have been caused by yield variability to a degree; however, a consistent decrease in yield differences with increasing segment lengths implied that better accuracies could be obtained in longer management areas. The combine responses to grain yield changes and the effect of varying ground speed on accuracy were also evaluated by creating artificial yield patterns in harvest strips. Grain diffusion within the combine was more obvious when abrupt yield changes were introduced at known locations. Grain mixing and redistribution inside the combine may dictate the selection of segment sizes in the site-specific decision making process. Constant ground speed provided more stable grain flow values than varying ground speed. The average error in yield estimate was 3.4% and 5.2% at constant ground speed and varying speed, respectively. Careful calibration and constant combine speed were important to achieve better accuracy with the grain yield monitor.},

  abstract  = {Floral plantings are promoted to foster ecological intensification of agriculture through provisioning of ecosystem services. However, a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of different floral plantings, their characteristics and consequences for crop yield is lacking. Here we quantified the impacts of flower strips and hedgerows on pest control (18 studies) and pollination services (17 studies) in adjacent crops in North America, Europe and New Zealand. Flower strips, but not hedgerows, enhanced pest control services in adjacent fields by 16% on average. However, effects on crop pollination and yield were more variable. Our synthesis identifies several important drivers of variability in effectiveness of plantings: pollination services declined exponentially with distance from plantings, and perennial and older flower strips with higher flowering plant diversity enhanced pollination more effectively. These findings provide promising pathways to optimise floral plantings to more effectively contribute to ecosystem service delivery and ecological intensification of agriculture in the future.},

  title     = {Field boundary features can stabilise bee populations and the pollination of mass-flowering crops in rotational systems},
  year      = {2021},
  volume    = {In press},
  abstract  = {1. Pollinators experience large spatio-temporal fluctuations in resource availability when mass-flowering crops are rotated with resource-poor cereal crops. Yet, few studies have considered the effect this has on pollinator population stability, nor how this might be mitigated to maintain consistent crop pollination services.

2. We assess the potential of boundary features (standard narrow 1m grassy margins, hedgerows and wide 4m agri-environment margins) to support and stabilise pollinator populations and pollination service in agricultural landscapes under crop rotation. Assuming a six-year rotation, we use a process-based pollinator model to predict yearly pollinator population size and in-crop visitation rates to oilseed rape and field bean across 117 study landscapes in England with varying amounts of boundary features. We model both ground-nesting bumblebees and solitary bees and compare the predictions including and excluding boundary features from the landscapes.

3. Ground-nesting bumblebee populations, whose longer-lifetime colonies benefit from continuity of resources, were larger and more stable (relative to the no-features scenario) in landscapes with more boundary features. Ground-nesting solitary bee populations were also larger but not significantly more stable, except with the introduction of wide permanent agri-environment margins, due to their shorter lifetimes and shorter foraging/dispersal ranges.

4. Crop visitation by ground-nesting bumblebees was greater and more stable in landscapes with more boundary features, partly due to increased colony growth prior to crop flowering. Time-averaged crop visitation by ground-nesting solitary bees was slightly lower, due to females dividing their foraging time between boundary features and the crop, but the more stable delivery compensated for this by nonetheless increasing the minimum pollination service delivered in any given year.

5. Synthesis and applications. Field boundary features have an important role in stabilising pollinator populations and pollination service in rotational systems, although maintenance of larger semi-natural habitat patches may be more effective for stabilising less mobile solitary bee populations. We recommend using combinations of boundary features, accounting for pollinator range when spacing features/rotating crops, and synchronising boundary feature management with crop rotation to maximise their stabilising benefits.},

  abstract  = {Field shelterbelts increase yields of field and forage crops throughout the world. The increases are due to reduced wind erosion, improved microclimate, snow retention and reduced crop damage by high winds. Crops differ in their responsiveness to shelter. Of the field and forage crops tested, winter wheat, barley, rye, millet, alfalfa and hay (mixed grasses and legumes) appear to be highly responsive to protection, while spring wheat, oats and corn respond to a lesser degree. Shelterbelt height and longevity, field width and shelterbelt orientation are major considerations in determining the effect of shelterbelts on crop yields. Precipitation has an effect on the percentage yield increase reported. Generally, percentage yield increases due to shelterbelts have been higher in drier regions or in drier years. By proper shelterbelt design and maintenance and the use of responsiveness crops, shelterbelt benefits to crop yields can be optimized.},

  abstract  = {Shelterbelts planted to control wind erosion indirectly affect the adjacent crop. Yield data were collected during 3 yr from 15 fields cropped mainly to spring wheat seeded on fallow, to quantify the competition and sheltering effects of the shelterbelts (about 6 m high and 200 m apart) and to relate these to microclimate and plant-available soil N, P and water. In 1989 and 1990, when moisture conditions during the growing season were dry and close to average, respectively, competition by the trees and their approximately 5-m-wide grass edge reduced crop yield about 10 m into the field. Yields were slightly above the field mean about 10–20 m from the field edge. The competition effect was smaller and the zone of improved crop growth was absent in 1991 when water was abundant. Plant-available N and P were close to the field means at the edge of the cultivated fields and were highest about 10 m into the fields. Competition for water is believed to be the main reason for the reduced yields at the edge of the fields as most farmers seed-placed fertilizer P, and response to added fertilizer N appeared independent of distance from the shelterbelt. Competition for water occurs during the growing period of the crop, but also includes water taken up by the shelterbelt when the field is in fallow. The improved crop growth 10–20 m from the field edge appears related to the reduction in potential evaporation as distance to the shelterbelt decreases.},

  abstract  = {- Little is known on the simultaneous delivery of ecosystem services by agri-environment schemes
- We quantify the impact of hedgerows and grass strips on a range of ecosystem services
- We describe multifunctionality and trade-offs on parcel level
- The trade-off between crop yield and other ecosystem services is context specific.

In north western Europe, agricultural systems are generally managed to maximize the potential delivery of provisioning ecosystem services. This has often been at the expense of other ecosystem services. Because the current supply of most ecosystem services is insufficient to meet the increasing demand, particular attention to ecosystem service delivery and hence multifunctionality in agriculture is vital. In this paper, we quantitatively assessed the impact of hedgerows and grass strips bordering parcels with annual arable crops on the simultaneous delivery of a set of ecosystem services and from there we identified synergies and trade-offs on virtual parcels. After a systematic literature search, mixed models were applied on observations from 60 studies and quantitative effect relationships between ecosystem service delivery and hedgerow and grass strip characteristics were developed. Next to the hedgerow, until a distance of twice the hedgerow height, arable crop yield was reduced by 29%. Beyond this distance, until 20 times the hedgerow height, crop yield was increased by 6%. Compared to a similar arable parcel without hedgerow or grass strip, soil carbon stock was 22% higher in the hedgerow, on average 6% higher in the adjacent parcel next to the hedgerow and 37% higher in the upper 30 cm soil layer in the grass strip. Both hedgerows and grass strips intercepted nitrogen from the surface (69% and 67%, respectively) and subsurface (34% and 32%, respectively) flow and phosphorus (67% and 73%, respectively) and soil sediment (91% and 90%, respectively) from the surface flow. More natural predator species were found on parcels with hedgerows, but the number of predators was unaffected. On parcels with grass strips, both predator density and diversity was higher and aphid density was reduced. Our calculations on parcel level indicate that the trade-off between arable crop yield and regulating ecosystem services depends on hedgerow width and height and parcel dimensions. A similar trade-off is found on parcels with grass strips, but increasing grass strip width results in a proportionally higher delivery of regulating ecosystem services.},
