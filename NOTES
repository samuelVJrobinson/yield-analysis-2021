Things to test using Lan's yield data predictions

- Main question: Does yield increase with intermediate distance to edge
- Secondary: Does variance increase with intermediate distance to edge
- Tertiary: Do edge types matter? (e.g. forest different than road)

With each field: (N=2.5m)
- yield ~ s(dist to Edge), variance ~ s(dist to Edge)
- yield ~ s(dist to Edge, by = Edge type?): edge types = road, water, other crops, trees...


Among fields: (N=500)
- average field yield ~ total pixels that are within certain distance classes from edge + edge density of field
- average field yield variance ~ total pixels that are with certain distance classes from edge + edge density of field
